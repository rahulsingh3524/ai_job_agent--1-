This tool should be selected when the user expresses a desire to explore available job opportunities or inquire about job openings in a particular field.
    #     - Use find_recruiter_emails ONLY when the user wants to FIND/GET/SEARCH/SCRAPE RECRUITER EMAILS for specific companies, especially when they mention targeting specific organizations or industries. This tool should be used when the user is looking to connect with recruiters from particular companies to enhance their job search.
    #     - Use send_cold_emails ONLY when the user explicitly states they want to SEND/CONTACT/EMAIL recruiters with a personalized message. If the user mentions "send cold emails," "contact recruiters," "reach out to recruiters," or similar phrases, you MUST select the send_cold_emails tool.
